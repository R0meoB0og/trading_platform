# trading_platform
I wanted to create a very simple, visually-appealing MVP for a trading platform that has a green score system attached to stocks. These are the guiding principles of this task, which enabled me to come up with a simple yet very potent and representative outcome. 
The website contains a home page where 5 stocks, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Coca Cola Co, Disney & Exxon Mobil are presented. I have a csv called stocks that has information for these 5 stocks, which appears as animal_life_score , vegetation_score, water_quality_score, poverty_score, equality_score, education_score. The stocks appear with their average sustainability score next to them, which averages the scores that are in the csv. This score changes based on a dropdown filter where you select any of the 6 scores you are interested in. 
A further feature of the template website is the portfolio tab. Users are able to click on the stocks they are interested in, which creates a selection of these stocks in the portfolio tab. The average score of the portfolio is then computed and presented. 
The backend was all done in Python, using Flask and Pandas as main libraries. HTML and CSS were used for the frontend, to write the layout and style of the website.
